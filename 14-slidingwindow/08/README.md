Basically

Another way of breaking up the solution into its sub-solutions

When you iterate over all substrings, you're not iterating directly over the solution space. You're iterating over some other space, and trying to "catch" pieces of the solution

With the smart solution, you're basically deterministically generating/iterating over the solution space
