# Leetcode Problems

Restarting this after I deleted my old version of this repo I'd worked on.

A store of leetcode problems I've solved for practice, and my solutions for them. The problems and their categorization comes from website: https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/.

Most definitely an open-ended work-in-progress.

# Study tips

Digging into other people's solutions, and spending lots of time mastering a single problem is important. But, perusing through large quantities of problems to learn to identify different problem types is important as well. There are no shortcuts.

Looking at lots of problems will help you categorize problems quickly.

# Problem solving tips

Read the problem carefully. Reading the bounds on the inputs can help you approximate the complexity of the optimal solution.

Think carefully about how to parameterize the solution space.

## Problem Categories

1. Arrays
2. Dynamic Programming
3. Greedy
4. Fast and Slow Pointers
5. In-place reversal of a linked list
6. Two Pointers
7. Binary Search
8. BFS
9. DFS
10. Sorting
11. Backtracking
12. Heap
13. Intervals
14. Sliding Window
15. Topological Sort
16. Trie

## Code File Naming Scheme

- `Solution` = my present-day solution
- `OldSolution` = solutions that I came up with in the past, before I made the current version of this repository
- `Discussion` = other people's solutions that I thought were useful
